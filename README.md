# ML Dashboard Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates building machine learning models and dashboards to analyze sample business data.  
It covers **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.  

## 🗂 Project Structure
```
data/                # Input datasets
notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks with analysis and modeling
dashboards/          # Dashboard files (Power BI/Tableau or screenshots)
```

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Antile-Chenai/ml-dashboard-project.git
cd ml-dashboard-project
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏷 Usage
- Open `notebooks/ml_analysis.ipynb` to explore the dataset and models.
- Update `data/` with your own CSV files.
- Save dashboards in `dashboards/`.

## 📊 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve
- Dashboard visualizations (Power BI/Tableau)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Recommendations
- Add more datasets and notebooks for different ML use cases.
- Include screenshots or exported dashboards to showcase results.
